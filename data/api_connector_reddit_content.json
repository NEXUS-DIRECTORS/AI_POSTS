        "selftext": "To completely disregard the possibility of a bear market is naive. We just witnessed an insane memecoin bull run where coins like Fartcoin, Trump, and Goat hit billion-dollar market caps in days (to name just a few). That was real liquidity, and people actually got rich off it. There was literal euphoria just like we’ve seen at market tops before. There wasn't enough liquidity to pump utility coins which would explain the lack of performance to prior cycles.\n\nAnd let’s talk about Bitcoin. Last cycle, everyone was convinced we were going to $100K, but we topped out at $64k, an underwhelming top no one expected. This time we're all expecting 150k or above not realising how monumental 100k is. Should I mention the law of diminishing returns? Now, if you compare the current price structure to the first top before the second top last cycle, the similarities are hard to ignore. History might not repeat exactly, but it sure does rhyme.\n\nOn top of that, ETF flows are slowing down, which means institutional demand isn’t as strong as it was at launch. NFT volume is down. Crypto Twitter engagement feels dead. Retail isn’t as active. All of these point to a shift in sentiment that could lead to lower prices.\n\nLet's not forget price not reacting to good news.\n\nAnd sure, I get it, this kind of uncertainty often signals a bottom. But does it really? What if we’re still in the denial phase and won’t realize it until Bitcoin is back below $60K? The market doesn’t always move in ways we expect, especially given the current economic uncertainty.\n\nI'm not saying for certain we are in a bear market but if we were, the signs are there and we should be ready for anything.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Are these signs valid, or is this just another shakeout before the next leg up?",

They are here to make quick bucks.. a lot of people got rich and rinsed from memescoin and AI Agent bubble. \n\nI am new in crypto. 2 years ish.. When i read about how people talk about the frenzy in altseason. It was the same with how people that got in the memescoin explosion desribe their experience but the differents was just the words \"memecoin\" and \"altseason\" \n\nI really dont know how to word this better.

ETH only started dumping at 00:21.\n\nEvidently it's manipulation, but I'm pretty curious how this can work in such a coordinated manner to have a stop hunt on a shitcoin 3 minute before the whole market dumps hard. Is the Binance market maker really the one crashing the market, and coordinately manipulating the altcoins to maximum extract on the way down?\n\nThough, if this is the case - why would they want to do this?
