How do we treat them?\n\nIt falls into four main categories:\n\n1. **Indifference, leading to mass deaths and extinction**. Think of all the mindless habitat destruction because we just don‚Äôt really care if some toad lived there before us. Think how we‚Äôve halved the population of bugs in the last few decades and think ‚Äúhuh‚Äù then go back to our day.\n2. **Interest, leading to mass exploitation and torture**. Think of pigs who are kept in cages so they can‚Äôt even move so they can be repeatedly raped and then have their babies stolen from them to be killed and eaten.\n3. **Love, leading to mass sterilization, kidnapping, and oppression**. Think of cats who are kidnapped from their mothers, forcefully sterilized, and then not allowed outside ‚Äúfor their own good‚Äù, while they stare out the window at the world they will never be able to visit and we laugh at their ‚Äúadorable‚Äù but futile escape attempts.\n4. **Respect, leading to tiny habitat reserves.** Think of nature reserves for endangered animals that we mostly keep for *our* sakes (e.g. beauty, survival, potential medicine), but sometimes actually do for the sake of the animals themselves.\n\nThis isn't a perfect analogy to how AIs that are superintelligent to *us* might treat us, but it's not nothing.

By decoding the fly‚Äôs neural signals‚Äîlike pheromones, movements, and neuron spikes‚ÄîAI can ‚Äútranslate‚Äù its ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù and even guide its behavior, creating a living neural network that can perform tasks beyond what biology or technology can do alone.

AI that ‚Äútalks‚Äù to the fly, translating its signals into commands and sending instructions back, linking biology and code.\n\nWhy It Matters Neurofly could transform:  \nExploration: Swarms of Neuroflies could map uncharted or hazardous areas, from ocean depths to disaster zones.\n\nEnvironmental Monitoring: These bio-drones could track pollution, climate change, or ecosystem health in real-time.\n\nNeuroscience: Studying AI‚Äôs interaction with the fly‚Äôs brain could unlock new insights into neural systems.\n\nWhen Will It Happen?

        "selftext": "Unlike painters and sculptors who never confuse their marble and pigment for the world itself, our ability to build richly detailed digital simulations has led some to treat these virtual constructs as the ultimate reality and future. This shift in perception¬†**reflects an egocentric projection‚Äîthe assumption that our creations mirror the very essence of nature itself**‚Äîand it fuels the popular notion of a technological singularity, a point at which artificial intelligence will eclipse human intellect and unleash unprecedented change. Yet while human technological progress can race along an exponential curve, natural evolutionary processes unfold under utterly different principles and timescales. Conflating the two is a flawed analogy: digital acceleration is the product of deliberate, cumulative invention, whereas biological evolution is shaped by contingency, selection, and constraint. Assuming that technological growth must therefore culminate in a singularity overlooks both the distinctive mechanics of human innovation and the fundamentally non-exponential character of natural evolution.\n\nConsider autonomous driving as a concrete case study. In 2015 it looked as if ever-cheaper GPUs and bigger neural networks would give us fully self-driving taxis within a few years. Yet a decade‚Äîand trillions of training miles‚Äîlater, the best systems still stumble on construction zones, unusual weather, or a hand-signal from a traffic cop. Why? Because ‚Äúdriving‚Äù is really a tangle of sub-problems: long-tail perception, causal reasoning, social negotiation, moral judgment, fail-safe actuation, legal accountability, and real-time energy management. Artificial super-intelligence (ASI) would have to crack thousands of such multidimensional knots¬†**simultaneously**¬†across every domain of human life. The hardware scaling curves that powered language models don‚Äôt automatically solve robotic dexterity, lifelong memory, value alignment, or the thermodynamic costs of inference; each layer demands new theory, materials, and engineering breakthroughs that are far from inevitable.\n\nNow pivot to the idea of merging humans and machines. A cortical implant that lets you type with your thoughts is an¬†*optimization*‚Äîa speed boost along one cognitive axis‚Äînot a wholesale upgrade of the body-brain system that evolution has iterated for hundreds of millions of years. Because evolution continually explores countless genetic variations in parallel, it will keep producing novel biological solutions (e.g., enhanced immune responses, metabolic refinements) that aren‚Äôt captured by a single silicon add-on. Unless future neuro-tech can re-engineer the full spectrum of human physiology, psychology, and development‚Äîa challenge orders of magnitude more complex than adding transistors‚Äîour species will remain on a largely separate, organic trajectory. In short, even sustained exponential gains in specific technologies don‚Äôt guarantee a clean convergence toward either simple ASI dominance or seamless human-computer fusion; the path is gated by a mosaic of stubborn, interlocking puzzles rather than a single, predictable curve.\n\n",
